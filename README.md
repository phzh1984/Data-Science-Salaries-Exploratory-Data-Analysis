# Data-Science-Salaries-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of a dataset focusing on data science job salaries. The aim is to uncover hidden patterns within the dataset and extract valuable insights using interactive visual tools like Plotly.

Project Overview

This project delves into an 11-column dataset comprising information about data science job salaries. The dataset includes the following columns:

work_year: The year the salary was paid.

experience_level: The experience level in the job during the year.

employment_type: The type of employment for the role.

job_title: The role worked in during the year.

salary_currency: The currency of the salary paid as an ISO 4217 currency code.

salaryinusd: The salary in USD.

employee_residence: Employee's primary country of residence during the work year as an ISO 3166 country code.

remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely.

company_location: The country of the employer's main office or contracting branch.

company_size: The median number of people that worked for the company during the year.

Understanding Domain Knowledge

The significance of domain knowledge in data science cannot be overstated. It's the foundational understanding of the industry or field to which data methodologies are applied. Without this knowledge, the efficacy of a data scientist can be limited, regardless of their technical expertise.

To enhance domain knowledge, individuals can select a field of interest (e.g., sports analytics, neuroscience, autonomous systems, etc.) and gradually acquire fundamental understanding while developing projects within that field.
